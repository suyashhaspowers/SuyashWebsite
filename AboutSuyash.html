		<p id="AboutText">Hi, my name is Suyash Unnithan and welcome to my website. I was born on March 1st, 2001 in the vibrant city of Tallinn, Estonia. I am the 2nd born child in the family, which makes me the youngest and the most privileged. I presently live in Canada with my older brother, mother and father and currently attend Glenforest Secondary School as a student in which I am privileged enough to be enrolled in the International Baccalaureate Program. I am an ardent devotee of soccer/football and follow Real Madrid. In my spare time, I like video/photo editing, playing soccer, coding, gaming and watching movies. In the year 2019, I will pursue my dream of going to The University of Waterloo for Computer Science or Software Engineering. This is where I will use all of the knowledge that I have accumulated over the course of my life and put it to the test if I wish to get a job with either Apple, Microsoft or Google, the company that I believe will revolutionize the field of technology in the future.</p>
